# Nodester is an Open Source Node.JS Hosting PaaS with a CLI and RESTful API

Nodester is a free and open source Node.JS hosting platform and service for managing multi-tenant hosted NodeJS apps.  It consists of an RESTful API that allows developers to create and manage NodeJS apps online as well as a command line interface to simply steps instead of using cURL.  NodeJS apps names are assigned as subdomains that proxy to ports with an assigned addresses.  Git is used to push updates to Nodester and instances (dynos) are launched using post-receive hooks so that they run until you stop them.

## Installing Nodester on Amazon EC2, Rackspace, GoGrid, or your own datacenter services

Please [read the wiki](https://github.com/nodester/nodester/wiki/Install-nodester) for setup instructions 

## Testing Locally

Subdomains can be tested locally by editing /etc/hosts like this:
127.0.0.1	localhost a.localhost b.localhost c.localhost
save etc/hosts and flush DNS like this: sudo dscacheutil -flushcache

*  http://localhost:80 # Homepage
*  http://a.localhost:80 # Runs app associated with subdomain a on couch-configured port
*  http://b.localhost:80 # Runs app associated with subdomain b on couch-configured port
*  http://chris:123@api.localhost:80/status # API to list status of all node apps

## Todos

We are always looking for areas to improve Nodester!  Here are a few of the big ideas on our list

* Setup public AMI running Nodester
* Write an install.js script and npm installer module
* Ability to start app with additional instances (dynos)
* Horizontal scaling
* Add Support for Crypto frameworks

Feel free to suggest improvements at https://github.com/nodester/nodester/issues
